For today’s class I worked on the background of my website. I was able to create my plan for how to access the specific parts of my website, and began to incorporate it into my design. I used some of the buildings that already existed in the image and some new ones in order to make the “About Me,” “Journal,” and “Projects” sections. I wasn’t able to fully center one of my buildings and bring them lower, but it mostly seemed to be ok.

For today’s class, I had to redo most of my website that hadn't been saved. I had to redo all of the buildings and commands that opened the new sites. I tried a bunch of different techniques and codes to access the different parts of the site, and I was able to do it. I worked more on the main website background, but I also spent some time on my journal section. I wanted to add a few more specific details in my journal section, but I need to work on it more in order to make it better, and not just a blank screen. I’m looking forward to incorporating my journal entries and start to work on my other project sections.
